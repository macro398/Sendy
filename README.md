# Sendy
This is a project created to impliment the use of Sendy to replace an existing newsletter and marketting tool. 

The project scrapes the raw http from a wordpress website and takes individual posts, in this case books, and creates newsletters in Sendy with appropriate subscribers based off 
the book's genre and combines multiple books and genres into the same email depending on customer interests. 

For example:
If Alison likes Mysteries, Westerns, and Romance novels, and Barry only likes Mystery novels, and today there were two Mystery novels and a Romance novel, Alison would 
recieve one email containing all three novels, while Barry would recieve one email just containing the two Mystery novels.


This was more of a proof of concept as one of my first solo coding projects. After gaining more knowledge and experience I realize this was not the best way to do it, but
at the time it made more sense to me to do it this way.
